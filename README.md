## Problem Statement :
In this project Create a dashboard in Power BI for the call center manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

## Datasource :

The dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.pwc.ch/en/careers-with-pwc/students/virtual-case-experience.html) and call centre trends dataset:

Dataset: [Call Centre Trends](https://github.com/Anabil12/PWC-Power-BI-Virtual-Work-Experience/blob/main/01%20Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx)

## Data Preparation:

Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset was loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

Call Center Trends dataset is give table named:

- " Call Center trends dataset" which has `10 columns and 5000 rows` of observation

Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:

- Removed Unnecessary columns
- Removed Unnecessary rows
- Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type

## Data Modeling:

And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data modeled.

- The `measure table` and `call centre trends` tables as show below:

## Data Analysis (DAX):

Measures used in  all visualization are:

- Average of seed of answered = `AVERAGE('call centre trends'[Speed of answer in seconds])`

- Average of satisfaction = `AVERAGE('call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating])`

- Count satisfaction rating = `COUNT('call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating])`

- Overall Customer Satisfaction = `DIVIDE([Possitive satisfaction rating],[Count satisfaction rating],0)`

- Positive satisfaction rating = `CALCULATE(COUNT('call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating]),FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Satisfaction rating] IN {4,5}))`

- resolved calls = `COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Resolved] = "Yes"), 'call centre trends'[Resolved])`

- Unresolved calls = `COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Resolved] = "No"), 'call centre trends'[Resolved])`

- total calls =  `CALCULATE('Table'[total calls answered] + 'Table'[total calls unanswred])`

- total calls answered = `COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)] = "Yes"),'call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)])`

- total calls unanswered =`COUNTX(FILTER('call centre trends','call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)] = "No"), 'call centre trends'[Answered (Y/N)])`

## Data Visualization (Dashboard) :
